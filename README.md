The **Aquarius<sup>+</sup> Studio** application is designed as a consolidated set of tools for designer/programmers using the **Aquarius<sup>+</sup>** computer.

It currently offers the following tool:

In development are these tools:
* **BMP1 Tool** - Import image files, adjust the palette and dithering, and export to the 1 bit-per-pixel BMP1/BM1 bitmap image file format for **Aquarius<sup>+</sup>**.
* **Tile Tool** - Import and manipulate image files, and relocate tiles for use within the **Aquarius<sup>+</sup>** VRAM space.
* **Text Screen Tool** - Develop screens for 40 or 80 column text mode using AQUASCII characters, paint in 2x3, 2x2, or 2x4 bloxel mode, edit palettes and custom character sets, then export to SCRN/SCR screen format for **Aquarius<sup>+</sup>**.
